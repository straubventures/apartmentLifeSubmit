# apartmentLifeSubmit

This repo builds a webpage designed to accept submissions for a photo contest. The webpage is live at apartment-life-submit.herokuapp.com.

The project sends a picture to my google drive. It is named with a unique identifier via concatenating the user's email to their photo's filename. Their form information
is sent to Google Sheet, which is then easily used to randomly determine the winner.

Thank you for reading! Let me know if you have any questions.
